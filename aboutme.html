                    <p><big> My name is George, I'm from San Francsico and born and raised out here as well.
                      I enjoy going out and making progress with my life.Getting able to travel and being
                    around friends and family that wants to see you succeed is a bonus on why I push myself.I plan on working with
                    wireless microwave communications in the future giving me a chance to go places all across the world working and
                    making a new experience, I plan on doing this once im done with school.
                    I like to think of myself as a person who likes to help others, and taking risks thats hard to over come.
                    I like to read and learn whenever I get the free time. One place I like to go to is the beach to to take my mind off things or just to think.
                    I'm a big sports fan and love to play
                    many sports that keeps me active.</big></p>
